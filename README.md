# rps_predictor

Interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors predictor built with React, Framer Motion, and a collection of ensemble AI forecasters.

## Local development

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the Vite dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the URL that Vite prints (defaults to http://localhost:5173).

## Production build

- Generate an optimized build with `npm run build`. The compiled assets land in `dist/`.
- Preview the production bundle locally with `npm run preview` (served on http://localhost:4173).

## Docker

1. Build the image: `docker build -t rps-predictor .`
2. Run the container: `docker run --rm -p 8080:80 rps-predictor`
3. Visit http://localhost:8080 to play the game.

The Docker image uses a multi-stage build (Node for compilation, Nginx for serving static files). Rebuild the image whenever you change application code.
